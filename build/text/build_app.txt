build_app module
****************

Description:
   This module builds an already created application by configuring
   and compiling it using CMake. It ensures the application's
   workspace is set correctly and handles platform-specific settings.

Modules Used: - argparse - os - utils - build_bsp - create_app -
open_amp - validate_bsp

Supported Use Cases: - Build a newly created application from source.
- Ensure correct platform setup before build. - Automatically link
libraries based on domain configuration.

Validation and Usage: - Validated by switching between platforms and
ensuring build success. - Usage example: Run *python build_app.py -w
<workspace_dir>*.

class build_app.Build_App(*args: Any, **kwargs: Any)

   Bases: "BSP"

   Description:
      Helps in setting up the application directory structure and
      initiates the build process by extending the BSP class
      functionalities.

   Parameters:
      **args** (*dict*) -- Dictionary containing workspace, build, and
      source directory paths.

   Returns:
      None

   Return Type:
      None

   This class performs the following tasks: - Builds directory
   structure based on workspace, source, and build directories. -
   Initializes BSP environment required for app compilation.

build_app.build_app(args)

   Description:
      Builds the application by first setting up the BSP, configuring
      CMake, handling platform-specific adjustments, and compiling the
      source code.

   Parameters:
      **args** (*dict*) -- Contains workspace, source, and build
      directory paths along with other build options.

   Returns:
      None

   Return Type:
      None

   This function performs the following tasks: - Initializes Build_App
   to set up paths. - Generates BSP if not already configured. -
   Updates CMake options based on language and platform. - Runs CMake
   and make commands to build the application.

build_app.main(arguments=None)

   Description:
      Parses command-line arguments and initiates the application
      build process.

   Parameters:
      **arguments** (*list**, **optional*) -- List of command-line
      arguments. Defaults to None.

   Returns:
      None

   Return Type:
      None

   This function performs the following tasks: - Parses user-provided
   arguments (workspace, build directory, source directory). - Sets up
   logging verbosity. - Calls the build_app function to build the
   application.
