create_bsp module
*****************

This module creates a domain and a bsp for the passed processor, os
and system device tree combination.

class create_bsp.Domain(args)

   Bases: "Repo"

   This class helps in creating a software domain. This contains
   functions to create the domain's directory structure, validate the
   user inputs for the domain on demand and manipulate the cmake
   toolchain file as per the user inputs.

   apps_cflags_update(toolchain_file, app_name, proc)

      This function acts as a helper for toolchain_intr_mapping. This
      adds template application specific compiler entries in the cmake
      toolchain file of the domain.

      Parameters:
         * **toolchain_file** (*|*) -- The toolchain file that needs
           to be updated

         * **app_name** (*|*) -- Specific app name that needs new
           entries

         * **proc** (*|*) -- Proc specific data pertaining to the app.

      Returns:
         returns the new compiler flags that were set.

      Return type:
         compiler_flags (str)

   build_dir_struct()

      Creates the include, lib and libsrc folder inside bsp directory.

   toolchain_intr_mapping()

      We have reference toolchain files in embeddedsw which contains
      default compiler related cmake inputs. This function copies the
      toolchain file according to user os and processor input in the
      domain directory. Once copied, it manipulates few entries in the
      file needed for specific proc /os/app scenario.

      In addition, this function also processes the sdt directory to
      create a a single system dts file that has interrupts correctly
      mapped as per the input processor.

      Returns:
         Processed system device tree file that would be used across
         the
            created domain for further processing.

         toolchain_file (str):
            Toolchain file for cmake infra that would be used across
            the created domain for builds.

      Return type:
         sdt (str)

create_bsp.create_domain(args)

   Function that uses the above Domain class to create the baremetal
   domain. :param args: Takes all the user inputs in a dictionary.
   :type args: dict

create_bsp.lop_create_target(lop_cmds)

create_bsp.main(arguments=None)
